# Comments

Spent little more time then expected as it was my first attempt parse CVS file. Was little tricky at first but also very exciting.
Regarding validation and CVS file layout, had to refresh my memory with array methods, witch was great!

Due to lack of time, I couldn't write tests to check if my function to find most popular bikes works. It also got tricky as I used context and even when i debugged screen, content was not showing.

Overall, challenge was very interesting. Not just learned new things but also practiced what was slightly forgotten.
